            <p>There may be killer asteroids headed for Earth, and NASA has decided to do something about it. The space
                agency announced a new ""Grand Challenge"" on June 18 to find all dangerous space rocks and figure out
                how to stop them from destroying our planet.</p>
            <p>The new mission builds on projects already underway at NASA, including a plan to <a href=""

                    _blank"">capture an asteroid</a>, pull it in toward the moon and send astronauts to visit it. As
                part of the Grand Challenge, the agency issued a ""request for information"" today — aiming to solicit
                ideas from industry, academia and the public on how to improve the asteroid mission plan.</p>
            <p>""We're asking for you to think about concepts and different approaches for what we've described here,""
                William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human explorations and operations, said
                yesterday during a NASA event announcing the initiative. ""We want you to think about other ways of
                enhancing this to get the most out of it.""</p>

                    astronauts flying on NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion space capsule under development,

                    in debate, would cancel the mission and steer the agency toward other projects. That bill will be

                        NASA officials defended the asteroid mission today and said they were confident they'd win
                        Congress' support once they explained its benefits further.<br><br>""I think that we really,
                        truly are going to be able to show the value of the mission,"" NASA Associate Administrator Lori
                        Garver said today. ""To me, this is something that what we do in this country — we debate how we
                        spend the public's money. This is the beginning of the debate.""<br><br>Garver also maintained
                        that sending astronauts to an asteroid would not diminish NASA's other science and exploration
                        goals, including another lunar landing.<br><br>

                            work,"" she said. ""This is only a small piece of our overall strategy, but it is an
                            integral piece. It takes nothing from the moon.""<br><br>Part of NASA's plan to win support
                            for the flight is to link it more closely with the larger goal of protecting Earth from

                            manages to alter its course, ""it will be one of the most important accomplishments in human
